# MeetTheRich

A fullstack project site that connects users to the top 10 billionaires of the world, you can pick a date and login/register to make you order, then you can see all your orders and delete any of them if you want. This project is a RESTful application that works with JPA to send data to a PostgreSQL database, in the view layer I've used the ReactJS with react router.


## Technologies used
- Java/Spring (Web, Boot, Security)
- OAuth2 authentication with JWT token
- Postgre database
- ReactJS front-end with the use of the JS fetch and some state management
- React router for front-end deploy
